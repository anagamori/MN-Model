% Adjust recruitment threshold the ratio of somatic surface area to toal
% cell surface area, P, in Booth 1999

% Adjust the minimal discharge rate at the recruitment threshold using the
% solow postasium conductnace, K_Ca_f 

% Record the peak discharge rate 

% How do we adjust the slope of f-I relationship? 

% An increase in leak conductance increases the initial slope, making the
% f-I relationship more non-linear, and increases the current threshold
